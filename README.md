# Cash Maundy 💸🙏

## http://cashmaundy.herokuapp.com/

One of my biggest pet peeves is having a little bit of left over money on a tap up card. In my building, laundry costs $1.75 and you need to put a minimum of $10 on it so I got inspired to write this very simple calculator to let me and other residents know the bare minimum to zero out your card based on what's on it already.

This is a personal learning project so some comments and logs are left as reference points.
